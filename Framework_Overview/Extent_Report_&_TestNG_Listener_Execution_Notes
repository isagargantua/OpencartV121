------------------------- EXTENT REPORT + LISTENER NOTES -------------------------

► Our ExtentReportManager class is attached to TestNG as a Listener.
  This listener captures every Test Case event (Pass / Fail / Skip) 
  and sends results directly to the Extent HTML report.

► How the flow works:
    1) When execution starts → a new HTML report is created.
    2) On every test success → test name is added in report as PASS.
    3) On failure → test name + failure reason + screenshot are added automatically.
    4) At the end of execution → report opens automatically.

► To run with Extent reporting:
   - Open any TestNG XML file and make sure <listeners> section refers 
     to the ExtentReportManager class.

► Important checks to understand behaviour:
   1) Try failing one test intentionally (for example by giving wrong 
      password from config.properties). 
      You will see:
         - Test marked as FAILED
         - Screenshot attached in report
         - Exception message shown under that test.

   2) For failed test re-execution:
      After execution, open:
         test-output → testng-failed.xml
      This file contains only failed tests (TestNG feature).
      Run this file to re-execute failed test cases only.

► Key Outputs:
   - Complete HTML report with pass/fail details → in /reports folder.
   - Failed test screenshots → inside /screenshots folder.

This helps in debugging and detailed reporting for hybrid automation framework.
