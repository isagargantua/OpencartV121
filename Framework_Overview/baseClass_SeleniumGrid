/*
 This block of logic controls how the WebDriver instance is created based on
 the execution environment and browser type selected by the user.

 First, we check a value from the properties file named 'execution_env'.
 If it equals "remote", it means we want to run our tests on a Selenium Grid system.

 When running in remote mode, we must define two important parameters:
 1) Operating System
 2) Browser type
 
 For this purpose, a DesiredCapabilities object is created. This object stores
 required configuration about OS and browser, which will be sent to the Grid Hub.

 Next, we validate the operating system value coming from user/test configuration:
 - If OS = "windows" → platform is set to Windows 11 node.
 - If OS = "mac"     → platform is set to Mac node.
 - If OS value is not recognized → execution stops and prints a message.
 This ensures Grid knows on which type of machine the browser must run.

 After OS selection, browser selection occurs through a switch condition:
 - If browser = "chrome" → capability browserName is set to Chrome.
 - If browser = "edge"   → capability browserName is set to Microsoft Edge.
 - If browser name does not match → execution stops and prints message.
 This helps Selenium Grid decide which browser instance should be opened remotely.

 Once OS and browser are successfully selected, the RemoteWebDriver is created.
 We provide the Selenium Grid Hub address (IP + port) along with capability object.
 This connects our test to a remote machine/node and runs the browser there
 instead of our local PC.

 The next part handles LOCAL execution mode.
 If 'execution_env' equals "local", tests run on the current machine,
 not on Grid. Here no capabilities or hub URLs are required.

 Based on the browser name received:
 - If browser = "chrome" → a normal ChromeDriver object is created locally.
 - If browser = "edge"   → an EdgeDriver object is created locally.
 - If browser name is invalid → execution stops and prints a message.

 In summary:
 - Remote mode: used for Selenium Grid environment, supports distributed execution.
 - Local mode : used for running tests directly on the current machine.

 This structure allows the same codebase to run tests locally or remotely
 simply by changing values in property file without touching the core logic.
